try submitting greedy search
debug moves being shit


why tf are the eliminations so stupid


reduce branching factor, get rid of some branches


switch to min max












need to do way more iterations







need to do a more accurate backprop than 1 or 0 with win or lose, do heuristic
winning in less moves should be a higher score
losing in less moves should be a lower score


try to limit depth




Avoid going all in on the same column
  multiply rows * columns to create this
  


why is there a board with only blue? 
derive board only places in one colour, need to make a function which alternates in colour

Add in to just use greedy heuristic if the number of squares on the board is low as the branching factor is too high
Visualise the game tree and see if everything is working














avoid adding all children to speed up performance



debug when iterations is 1
