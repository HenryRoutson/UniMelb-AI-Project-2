To ensure that our MCTS algorithm was correcly implimented, 
we developed it in a game enironment with objectively good or bad actions.
This environment was a simple game where the state and actions were integers where actions were added to the state.
The goal of agent 1 was to get the highest number and agent 2 the lowest.

Because picking the highest or lowest number is objectively the best action
this allowed us to 
  + verify our min max implimentation
  + verify accuracy of our mcts

For example

  For actions [2,1,-1,2] :

  A min max action sequence of [2,2,2,2,2] indicates that there is an error with the min max implimentation.

  A min max action sequence of [1,-1,1,-1,1] indicates an ineffective mcts.

  A min max action sequence of [2,-2,2,-2,2] indicates a proper and effective implimentation
